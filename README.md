# End-to-end tests for the Asset Register application

This repository holds a series of Jasmine test suites containing end-to-end tests for an 
[Asset Register application](https://se.sencha.com/AssetRegister/Login.aspx), 
built with Sencha Ext JS 6.2 Modern Toolkit.

These tests will run using Sencha Test 2.x.

## Steps

1. Open the workspace folder in Sencha Studio.

2. Sign up for an account on the [Asset Register app](https://se.sencha.com/AssetRegister/Register.aspx).

3. Update the login credentials being used in both the `Login.js` and `User.js` test suites.

4. Update the URL that's used for the tests - append your API Key (this is emailed to you when you Register for an account). By 
  appending your API Key, data is reset for your user account when the test run commences.

5. Run the tests within Sencha Studio.
